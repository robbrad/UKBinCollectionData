This Markdown document provides a list of commands and parameters for use with this script.

As a reminder, most scripts only need a module name and a URL to run, but others need more parameters depending on how the data is scraped.

For scripts that need postcodes, these should be provided in double quotes and with a space, e.g. `"AA1 2BB"` rather than `AA12BB`.

This document is still a work in progress, don't worry if your council isn't listed - it will be soon!
